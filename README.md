# Memory-Game
The idea of the game is to find identical pairs among a shuffled pack of cards laid out.

A player then selects two cards that are face down, turns them face up, and if the cards match they are left face up. If the two cards do not match they are returned to their original face down position. The game continues until all cards are
face up.
16 cards are shuffled and laid out in a 4 by 4 square. These cards are labeled with pairs of card numbers (A, Q, K, J, 2, 5, 6, 9).
The program allows the player to specify the cards that she would like to select through a coordinate system.
For example, in the following layout:
	        1 2 3 4
        1	A S $ $
        2 $ $ $ $
        3	$ A $ $
        4	$ $ $ $
All of the cards are face down indicated by $. The pairs of A which are face up and at coordinates (1,1) and (2,3). 

The game terminates when all pairs are found!
